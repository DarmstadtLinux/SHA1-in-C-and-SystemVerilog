# SHA1-in-C-and-SystemVerilog
This SHA1 algorithms should run in C ( NIOSII ) and System Verilog on a FPGA !


Welcome to the SHA1-in-C-and-SystemVerilog wiki!

I created those SHA1 codes for a benchmark test: The C Code is supposed to run on a Soft Core NIOS II The System Verilog Sha1 code is supposed to run on the FPGA What is faster !?
